# DGK Law and Cognition

Welcome to the **DGK Law and Cognition** GitHub organization at UCLA, managed by David G. Kamper. This organization integrates David's work in cognitive neuroscience, computational cognitive science, and legal scholarship to explore the cognitive underpinnings of legal decision-making across multiple domains of law, including intellectual property, constitutional law, and tort.

## About David G. Kamper

David G. Kamper is a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he works in the [Reasoning Lab](https://reasoninglab.psych.ucla.edu/) advised by Keith Holyoak, Hongjing Lu, and Patricia Cheng. He collaborates with [Craig Fox](https://www.craigrfox.com/) and [Jaime Castrellon](https://www.castrellonlab.psych.ucla.edu/). David will also formally begin law school in Fall 2026 and is supported as an NSF GRFP Fellow.

## Mission

Our mission is to advance the understanding of how cognitive processes shape legal reasoning, creativity in intellectual property, constitutional interpretation, and moral decision-making in the context of the law.

## Core Research Areas

### 1. Cognitive Neuroscience and Intellectual Property Law
We investigate the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and intellectual property law, particularly copyright, trademark, and patent law. Our research explores:
- The cognitive neuroscience of creativity and aesthetic judgment.
- Decision-making processes underpinning legal judgments about intellectual property.

### 2. Psycholinguistics and Constitutional Law
We study constitutional interpretation through psycholinguistic approaches, examining how linguistic structure and cognitive processes influence constitutional understanding and judicial decision-making.
- Analysis of conditional dependencies and syntactic ambiguity in constitutional texts.
- Rational Speech Act (RSA) modeling applied to constitutional interpretation, such as Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.

### 3. Moral Psychology and Legal Decision-Making
Our research investigates how moral cognition informs legal judgments and the conceptualization of intent, mens rea, and ethical decision-making within criminal and tort law.
- Counterfactual reasoning and cognitive biases in legal judgments.
- Behavioral and computational modeling of moral intuitions in legal contexts.

### 4. Computational Cognitive Modeling
Using computational models, we analyze how social networks and individual cognition shape the development of legal norms, intellectual property standards, and ethical frameworks across diverse legal contexts.

### 5. Data Science and Legal Cognition
We employ data-driven approaches to study naturalistic behaviors related to legal decision-making, creativity assessments, normative developments in intellectual property, and broader legal cognition phenomena.

## Current Projects
- **Cognitive Models of Creativity in Copyright and Trademark Law**: Exploring cognitive foundations influencing judgments of creativity and originality.
- **Social Network Influences on Intellectual Property Norms**: Computational analyses of how IP norms emerge and propagate.
- **Analogical Reasoning in Legal Cognition**: Investigating analogy in legal decision-making and its cognitive underpinnings.
- **Psycholinguistic Analyses of Constitutional Interpretation**: Modeling constitutional decision-making through linguistic and cognitive paradigms.
- **Moral Cognition and Mens Rea Judgments**: Understanding cognitive and moral processes influencing judgments of intent and culpability.
